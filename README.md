# ActiveRulesForGraphDatabases
Did this as part of my masterâ€™s degree project. 
Active rules for graph databases is an understanding and simulation of active rules/trigger functionality for Graph Databases using Neo4j. 
Defined semantics for the rules and used supply chain management system as the dataset and tested the rules on Neo4j using a custom-built java application.

Required Applications/Software:
1. NetBeans
2. Java SDK
3. Neo4j

Instructions to run the code:
1.After installing the software, build the code. Make sure that the project directory has the "Rules" folder with "Time-Based" and "Non-Time Based" sub-folders(This is to prevent an error occuring due to testing without event any rules present in the repository)
2. Select the applicaiton type by hard coding the application type number in the "Application Interface" class file in the project. (Please follow the comments present in the code).
3. Once set. please follow the instructions on screen to run the application.
