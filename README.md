# ActiveRulesForGraphDatabases
Did this as part of my masterâ€™s degree project. 
Active rules for graph databases is an understanding and simulation of active rules/trigger functionality for Graph Databases using Neo4j. 
Defined semantics for the rules and used supply chain management system as the dataset and tested the rules on Neo4j using a custom-built java application.
